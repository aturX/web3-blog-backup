A Web3 job is more than just a job. It’s a place with immense potential and career opportunities, where in just 3–6 months you can evolve from a content creator into a Web3 marketer Or, for instance, increase your salary from $1K per month to $10K per month This rapid growth is due to a shortage of experts, people who know how to build products, develop personal brands, effectively retain community attention, and handle many other factors I've discussed in this article Most importantly, you don't need prior experience. The key is to start right now Why Web3 jobs are attractive? Salary and difference with web2 Web3 Jobs Have higher salary potential Web3 experts often earn 20–100% more compared to similar roles in Web2 due to high demand and significant growth potential Companies and projects frequently compete fiercely for top talent and experienced professionals, which continues to drive compensation upward For example, the salary for a Community Manager with 2–3 years of experience in Web2 typically starts around $40–60K, while in Web3, the same position usually ranges from $60–100K Moreover, Web3 allows rapid career growth opportunities. There's a massive number of possibilities here because the industry is growing quickly and genuinely lacks sufficient experts That's why I initially chose Web3. Here, people value me for my skills and real-world experience. In contrast, in Web2, I constantly faced obstacles related to "traditional experience," which never truly contributed to my work efficiency Not to mention education, most Web3 jobs don’t even ask about your degree. What matters most is your skillset, real-world experience, and the desire to continually improve

Approximate Web3 Salaries: Honestly, it's difficult to give exact figures, as your main income in Web3 isn't usually limited to just salary alone If you're ready to work and keep growing, you can expect at least $1.5K–2.5K monthly for a part-time role (5–7 hours per day) Developer salaries, meanwhile, are nearly limitless, depending significantly on your specialization. If you have specific Web3 skills (like Rust or Solidity), your income can easily be 100–300% higher than equivalent Web2 developers Experienced marketers and advisors can expect a minimum of $5K per month for part-time roles, scaling all the way to $100K per month or more Ultimately, your earnings depend entirely on the value you provide. It's crucial to value your own time and objectively assess your skills, particularly the specialized ones I’ll cover later I'll dive deeper into salary details for each expert role further below when describing exactly who you could become

Popular job roles available Community-Manager (CM) Salary: $10K-$100K/year Responsibilities: CM build, engage, and maintain active communities around Web3 projects. They manage chats, organize events, handle community feedback, and ensure the community stays vibrant and involved 2. Blockchain Developer Salary: $60K-$250K/year Responsibilities: blockchain developers build decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and blockchain protocols. They're skilled in Solidity, Rust, or other Web3 programming languages, creating secure and scalable solutions (most often have experience in Web2 development too) 3. Web3 Marketer Salary: $50K-$200K/year Responsibilities: marketers develop and execute strategic marketing campaigns for Web3 projects. They handle branding, manage social media presence, coordinate influencer partnerships, optimize content strategies, and drive community growth and user acquisition through targeted marketing initiatives 4. Content creator (ghostwriter) Salary: $10K-$100K/year Responsibilities: content creators produce creating articles, videos, podcasts, or infographics tailored for projects or KOLs. They attract attention, educate audiences, and help projects gain visibility in a highly competitive market 5. Moderator Salary: $10K-$80K/year Responsibilities: moderators manage community chats, enforce rules, handle user inquiries, and maintain a positive, active environment within communities TL;DR This is far from all the possible job positions, but these are the most popular ones. I’ve always focused specifically on these roles because they’re always in demand and can easily shift their direction or the project they’re working on. Given the specifics of the Web3 market, this is a necessity, as they say, "adapt or die" Now let’s break down the different possible directions in the market

Identify your strengths and interests Figuring out your strengths is one of the most important factors in your work. And this isn't just about Web3, it's about life in general, in any area where you want to succeed. No matter how many material things you want, you won’t get them if you don’t enjoy the actual process — the work you do to earn them. If you’ve become a marketer, it’s important that you wanted to become one. That you feel it’s your thing. That you can easily communicate with clients, search for promotion strategies, test ideas, and not burn out when one of your strategies doesn’t work. In marketing, that’s completely okay. In Web3, a marketer is someone who has to go through five big failures before they win on the sixth try. And it’s not because they’re not an expert, it’s because the industry is growing so fast. Not everyone can adapt, and that’s a skill you have to build. Let’s be real — if you don’t enjoy what you do, you won’t get the dopamine boost that keeps you going And when the first problem hits, you’ll just think, “Why am I even doing this? I’d rather lie on the couch” Only warriors finish the journey, not because they need the result, but because they want to complete the challenge in their own mind. To understand if they truly enjoy it or not And even if they don’t — they’ll walk the path again. Not just chasing material goals (or maybe they are), but without obsessing over how much their life will change. Instead, they just keep taking action toward that change So, how do you actually figure out your strengths and interests? In Web3, figuring out your strengths means trying different roles, and actually paying attention to how each feels Maybe you're naturally curious, diving into threads about new projects, analyzing tokenomics, or breaking down complicated concepts into digestible tweets — that’s the heart of a content creator or researcher Or you might notice you're energized by networking, sliding into DMs, negotiating partnerships, and chatting comfortably with complete strangers — that's the BD Manager Are you the one who can patiently answer the same newbie questions all day without rolling your eyes? Then you're probably built to be a Community Manager or Moderator

It’s crucial to tune into your feelings as you try these roles: Do you feel satisfaction, even excitement, when solving community conflicts or structuring Discord channels? Are you genuinely thrilled when your tweet hits engagement milestones? Do you lose track of time when researching trends and drafting strategies? Web3 moves quickly. You’ll fail often, pivot frequently, and adapt constantly. Choosing the right role isn't about picking the easiest path, it’s about finding the path you’d walk willingly, even through chaos, uncertainty, and volatility Because when the market drops and everyone panics, you won’t. You'll keep going because you genuinely enjoy the game you're playing And that’s how you know you've found your strength How to build your web3 skill set (specific soft and hard skills) Web3 isn’t about education like in the school, it’s about real skills that show your strength under pressure, or in situations where even so-called “experts” don’t have a solution Once you build a solid set of specific skills, becoming a Web3 pro is honestly simple — just keep doing the work and getting better over time

The soft skills you absolutely need: Communication You have to know how to communicate properly in a professional tone, but with an understanding of what the person actually needs Every time you interact with someone, whether it’s in Discord, on X, or through email — pay attention to how they talk to you Always reply calmly. Never be toxic. Don’t show aggression in chats, no matter how frustrating things get. Stay neutral, even in tough situations 2. Proactiveness This isn’t about grinding 24/7 — it’s something deeper Considering that PMs often don’t assign tasks perfectly (Web3 is messy), it’s crucial to take initiative. Don’t wait for a task, suggest one. Saw a bug? Report it. Got an idea that could improve the project? Share it That’s how you show your value, and it's also how you move up the ladder faster than others 3. Fast Adaptation (Adapt or die) Learn to adapt quickly, to the market, to new tools, to whatever needs to be done Don’t treat every new task like a burden, just take it on with ease Web3 today might be Telegram, tomorrow it’s Farcaster. Don’t get stuck on fixed ideas — stay flexible, keep learning, and try to understand other people’s proposals even if they sound weird Truth is, many geniuses get overlooked just because people stick to old ideas — which might already be outdated in Web3 4. Independence You need to be able to deliver results without constant reminders. Come up with new ideas, even if no one asked you to You’re not just growing your own skillset — you’re actively helping the project succeed People like that always get noticed. And often, they get paid way more than others, even if their hard skills are at the same level 5. Empathy & Understanding I’ve seen plenty of “pros” who never made an effort to understand me, and that’s exactly why they lost the offer It’s not that I had less experience, it’s that they overestimated their ego and didn’t know how to work with people Don’t just reply to a user or a client, try to actually understand what they want. And do your best to make sure they leave satisfied

The hard skills you absolutely need: Writing You don’t need to become a poet, but you need to learn how to write in a way that grabs attention, and understand how to structure posts that people actually want to read It’ll help you with content, building your personal brand, crafting your CV, replying to clients, or even guiding the copywriter working with your team If you can write a tweet that hits 100K views or a guide people actually read — you're already ahead of most 2. Content Creation I separated this from “writing” because it’s not the same thing. Content creation is about knowing how to analyze what works and why That’s what made me good at it. People often ask me how I manage to always stay on trend and put out quality content consistently The truth? I just scroll X, watch what other KOLs are posting, and study the content that gets traction — views, replies, real engagement And no, it’s not about stealing posts. It’s about being inspired and asking yourself: “What’s a valuable angle this KOL didn’t cover, that I could explain better for my audience?” Write that — and trust me, it’ll probably become one of your top-performing tweets or threads. Also, learn how to work with visuals. Once I got a better designer and started giving him detailed briefs, my views jumped 20–30% almost instantly. Just start learning content the way I explained — don’t overcomplicate it. Every expert I know got good simply by studying content that performed well and figuring out how to improve on it. If you can consistently improve just 5% over what’s already out there — you can already start making $2K+/month as an SMM 3. Research & Analytics Learn to analyze things properly and become a crypto pro — starting with research This is crucial. Without it, you won’t understand what you’re working on or how to assess competitors objectively Start learning data tools like Dune. Study how tokenomics works (really understand it, surface-level analysis is useless if you can’t tell whether it makes sense) When you understand the logic behind these things, you’ll start turning noise into actual insights — and that’s rare and valuable Honestly, without analytics you’ll stay a basic worker. In such a fast-moving niche, real success comes from knowing how to analyze the market and what it needs right now 4. Basic technical skills (even if you're not a dev) You don’t need to go deep into writing smart contracts, but you do need to understand how they work If you know the basics of EVM, how gas fees are calculated, how wallets interact with dApps, that already puts you ahead of most marketers, writers, and even BD folks in Web3 And it's not just about leveling up your skillset, it's also how you protect yourself A lot of scam projects look “safe” on the surface, but their smart contracts say otherwise If you can spot red flags in the code or at least understand the logic behind it, you’ll avoid getting burned Also, projects often focus heavily on their tech part If you don’t understand what they’re building, how are you supposed to write docs, explain features, or create a tweet that actually makes sense? Spend a few hours. Research how this stuff works Don’t get stuck — if you’re lost, ask ChatGPT 5. Idea generation (creative thinking under pressure) Idea generation is the skill that separates average professionals from top performers If you can come up with ideas and understand the likelihood of them working — people will value you way more It’s somewhat related to research, but it’s not the same You need to learn how to brainstorm properly, sit down with a product problem and force yourself to find solutions. Come up with a lot of ideas, then filter the ones that actually make sense and could be useful

How to find web3 jobs? My top 3 methods Looking for a job is a really important process for everyone, especially on a psychological level It’s where you truly start to feel whether you’re valued or not Honestly, based on my experience, finding a job isn’t hard at all — if you’re someone who helps solve real problems, or if you’re just ready to work hard, evaluate yourself honestly, and improve your strategy every time (whether it’s content writing or anything else) Finding your first job is definitely tougher, but it’s more than realistic, for most of you You don’t need to be a genius or have a perfect background You just need to show up, learn fast, and actually do the work Most people fail not because they’re not good enough, but because they never even start Applying and interviewing for web3 jobs The traditional way to find a job is by applying for open positions, similar to how you'd apply for an IT role in Web2 You fill out a form on a job board, attach your CV, and wait for a reply. Then you go through the interview process and eventually get an answer In my opinion, this is the least effective method — but it still deserves attention, especially if you’re a developer or work on the technical side. For you, this can be one of the more efficient ways to land a job, much more so than for a ghostwriter or moderator It’s especially ineffective for those with no experience at all — but don’t worry, I’ll break down two better options right after this. This method is mostly for those who already have some background, even if it’s from Web2 Top 5 job boards to find Web3 jobs: [cryptocurrencyjobs.co](http://cryptocurrencyjobs.co) [defi.jobs](http://defi.jobs) [web3.career](http://web3.career) [cryptojobslist.com](http://cryptojobslist.com) Just choose a relevant vacancy and apply. Of course, you’ll need a proper CV — so let’s go over how to create one next How to create effectivity CV? It’s important to create a simple and clear CV that’s easy to read and highlights your achievements effectively You can make it either in PDF format or using Notion Below, I’ll attach an example of my old CV (I don’t use it anymore because my personal brand does the job for me now) So, let’s break down the structure: Intro (1–3 sentences) A clear description of who you are, what you do, your key achievements, and what kind of clients or projects you’re interested in 2. Proof of Work Write a clear summary of the projects you’ve worked on and the services you can offer. For each project, it’s important to explain your role, how you contributed, and what specific soft/hard skills you applied. In my case, it looks more like a mini agency brief, but you can focus less on “Own Services” and more on: Specific cases Skills you've used Types of tasks you’re ready to take on Areas you’d like to work in 3. Honesty Don’t try to sound like an expert if you’re not one yet Make a simple CV that shows you’re a good person, eager to grow, and ready to solve real client problems effectively Also, be honest about your contributions to each project If you write that you did something you actually didn’t, clients will notice it as soon as you start working. And most likely, they won’t continue with you If you have no experience at all, do a few free tasks for clients who reach out to you. That way, you’ll at least have some rough case studies to show, and it’ll already make you more appealing to future employers Networking and finding opportunities Web3 is definitely about networking &gt; CV Most people I know landed jobs not by sending cold applications, but because they were already known, followed, or seen in action And yes — that’s exactly how it works. I’ve seen it first-hand I spent a long time applying to different jobs and trying random gigs — until I started focusing on networking. That’s when I instantly unlocked a new level of projects and opportunities You stop chasing opportunities — and they start chasing you And it all comes down to one key rule: "People &gt; Money" If I lost everything tomorrow, I’d still be able to work with tier-1 projects and get paid well — simply because: “they know me,” “we’ve already talked,” “I helped them once” So I decided to highlight the key principles on how to find those kinds of opportunities: Be active where potential employers can see you Show up on X: follow founders, investors, and active KOLs Reply to their tweets with real opinions (not “good thread bro,” but actual feedback) Join discussions — and bring value. Don’t just comment for attention, show your thinking, your skills, your perspective 2. Become a real part of the community you want to work in This can be through comments under posts on X, or being active in Discord/Telegram I’ve got some of my first jobs just by becoming part of a community Help out for free without being asked. Talk to everyone. People will give you the most valuable experience, don’t be afraid to ask Start conversations with the kind of people you want to become in top-tier projects. Ask them: “What makes you different from the average worker?” Understand what sets them apart, and start doing the same They’ll give you insane value just by sharing the situations they’ve already been through Nothing beats real-world experience or a mentor who’s already walked the path 3. DM 10 people every day you genuinely want to work with (founders, KOLs, or C-levels from projects you respect) Don’t use a template. Show your value in the very first message Be real: tell them who you are, why you care about their product, and how you could be helpful And most importantly — don’t ask for a job right away Come in as a potential partner, or someone genuinely interested in what they’re building. Ask how you can help That’s 10x more effective than “Hello sir, any job?” (founders hate that, they have limited time and get spammed daily. People like that waste their attention, so most just get ignored) Build a personal brand (aka make it so that opportunities find you) Your X = your CV Your content = a potential lead-generation funnel If you show up right on social media, the right people will notice you, and the right offers will find you The most important thing is to focus on what you enjoy and keep moving forward How to build a personal brand, even with just 100 followers: Pick your niche Don’t post about everything Choose a direction where you either already have some experience, or where you’re actively leveling up It can be anything: From creating Web3 content, to analytics/research, to working with communities/moderation Even being part of a community and slowly becoming a key figure in it, that’s community management too. Yes, your focus will shift over time, but don’t jump around daily between DeFi and memecoins lol Pick your lane and grow in it 2. Show your expertise, your real self, and your thoughts Your posts don’t have to be perfect. They’re just snapshots of your journey They should be useful, honest, and written with ease You don’t have to say “how I did X” — that’s not interesting if no one knows you yet Instead, break down a hyped project, but add your personal take Explain what you would’ve done better from a marketing angle That alone is your proof of brain, even without any CV 3. Post consistently Consistency is the most important key to success in content Even if you’re “nobody” right now, with no crazy case studies, I’ve been there too You can absolutely build it Never compare yourself to people who are getting temporary hype Most of the ones I started with are long gone, even though their results looked better than mine back then You’re building long-term Hard, useful posts are worth way more than shitposts about tier-5 tokens This is how you build trust and respect, especially through honesty 4. Start building your “social circle” Interacting with others is a must, you can’t grow in isolation Reply to people, support their content, and they’ll support yours It’s mutual energy. Growing alone is the slowest path Don’t be shy to message people you follow Exchange experiences. Don’t be just another silent reader Offer collabs, mutual posts, or simple discussions Over time this will build momentum — and your name will start popping up In Web3, it’s not just about what you know, it’s about who knows you There are tons of geniuses out there no one’s ever heard of, and because of that, they’ll never get the global results they actually deserve 5. Always combine this with content creation, research, and networking This will give your personal brand the biggest possible boost, because it’s the combo that really makes the difference If you combine all of this consistently, you’ll become one of the best in a short amount of time, if you’re truly putting in the work And honestly, this applies not just to Web3, but to any industry You become one of the top players through practice, while building your personal brand Then you start offering the same services for higher rates, and maybe even monetizing through quality sponsorships or collabs Just start Start now Stay consistent It’ll work out — it’s just a matter of time

Real case “How to start earn $3K+ on web3 job without any experience?” This story is based on real events over the past 6 months My friend reached out to me, asking if I had any work for him, and listed what he could do He also showed initiative, creating posts and threads for different people without being asked Within the first two months, he learned how to write structured threads, and started charging $30 per thread It wasn’t just “writing text”, it was proper analysis and adapting to someone’s tone of voice. But then he hit a wall. He wasn’t sure how to grow from there He kept asking himself, “Can I really raise my prices?” I helped him a bit and explained: the value isn’t in how much content you make, it’s in how good it is, and who you’re making it for So he focused on improving content quality, and in just a couple of months, he leveled up to $50 per thread, which is still far from the ceiling in ghostwriting lol Now, this same guy, who had no real experience, makes around $3K/month consistently, and plans to scale to $5K/month over the next 3 months This is exactly the kind of case that proves anyone who’s serious about doing high-quality work can make it And I’ve seen the same story play out with different people, in different roles The key is always the same: Work with quality. Charge what you’re worth. And people will value you The most common mistakes and misconceptions of beginners Most beginners make mistakes that seriously affect their journey, so I decided to mention this here This isn’t about “messing up a task” or struggling with work. It’s deeper than that It’s about things that affect all of us, but almost no one talks about The most common mistakes that keep people stuck, even if they have potential: Chasing money, not skills Saying “I want to make $5K–$10K/month” is a great goal But… do you deserve it? If you don’t know what you can actually bring to a project, no one’s going to pay you Especially if your usefulness ratio is negative People always ask me in comments: “Where do they pay more?” I always want to reply: “Everywhere, lol. Just choose something where you can be useful right now, and become good at it. Any field. All those numbers are possible — but only if you focus on providing value to others, not just getting profit for yourself” 2. Afraid to start without experience So many people never begin because they think: “I’m nobody yet… who would hire me?” I used to be the same. I kept reading, learning, trying to “get better” before starting But at some point, I realized that wasn’t leading anywhere — so I started looking for opportunities with the skills I already had Within a few months, I understood everything, from the basics to things even some “experts” didn’t get You show initiative → do something small → people notice → you get a shot You work → gain real experience → your income grows along with your value 3. Not building a personal brand You might be super talented, but if no one sees you, you don’t exist Start creating content, even if you only have 5 followers Every post is an open testimonial from you to the world — and even if you’re only speaking to yourself right now, others will find you over time 4. Too much information, zero action Unfortunately, this is the most common issue I see among friends IRL People get stuck in the “learning” phase: they read, listen to Spaces, scroll threads… But never try anything That’s how they kill their own potential Learning without action = procrastination disguised as progress If you’re not testing yourself, not getting feedback, not failing — you’re not actually growing 5. Overpromising what you can’t deliver I’ve said this before, but I’ll say it again, because even some “top” people still do this Most people overestimate themselves and try to make their CV or intro sound impressive, just so they don’t seem “uninteresting” But this kills opportunities When you act like an expert, someone might not offer you valuable experience, because they assume you wouldn’t care about it Then you start missing deadlines, trying to figure things out on the fly, and end up looking irresponsible, even if that’s not who you really are This damages your reputation, and hurts your future more than just starting from where you are right now
